            <dt>What technologies do you work with?</dt>
            <dd>I primarily use C++ and Java for backend as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for
                front end.

            <dd>
                We were working on a project for a data structures class but we were having scheduling
                issues because not everyone was in town at the time so we had to work towards a solution.
                One of my teammates suggested that we wouldn't need to meet up at all and everything could
                be completed through texts but I disagreed. I communicated with my teammate about the problem 
                so that we both understand what the problem that needs to be addressed. I suggested 
                that a meeting can happen as long as 2 or more members are available so that we could 
                communicate better and others can join later. 
                <em>We eventually reached a mutual agreement and completed the project on time.</em> 
            </dd>

            <dt>Share an example of a failure or setback.</dt>
            <dd>When I took my first college calculus class, I was overwhelmed by the workload and
            the amount of materials so I did not do well on my first midterm and I needed a decent GPA
            to transfer later. So I decided to fix my study habits, attend office hours, and seek help
            from tutoring services. In the end, I got an A in the class, which 
            <strong>proved that thinking of solutions to adapt to a new environment is extremely 
            important.</strong>
